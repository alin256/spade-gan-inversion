## Plotting script

To plot results from an example folder run **plotting.py** with a folder path as the only parameter. The script assumes that the results are already computed (see folders **HardData**, **SoftData1**, **SoftData2** for instructions).


Usage examples
```
python plotting.py ../HardData
```

```
python plotting.py ../SoftData2
```

The results are saved in **{the chosen example folder}/result.png"**
